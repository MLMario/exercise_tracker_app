# Phase 13: UI Polish

## Goal

Visual polish and branding updates to improve the app's appearance.

## Scope

### Item 1: Add Chart Button Styling
**Issue**: The "Add Chart" button doesn't match the app's design language.
**Expected**: Style to be consistent with other buttons in the app.

### Item 2: Logout Button Positioning
**Issue**: Logout button is not positioned correctly.
**Expected**: Proper placement matching the app's layout.

### Item 3: Remove Chart Button Styling
**Issue**: The "X" button to remove charts needs better styling.
**Expected**: More polished appearance matching app design.

### Item 4: Add Chart Form Background
**Issue**: The "Add Chart" form lacks visual distinction.
**Expected**: Add transparency/backdrop to the form background for better UX.

### Item 5: App Title Rename
**Issue**: App is currently named "Exercise Tracker".
**Expected**: Rename to "Ironlift Strength" throughout the app.
