# Requirements: Exercise Tracker App

**Defined:** 2026-02-02
**Core Value:** Simple, effective workout tracking with clean visual feedback on progress

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for v2.8 Enhanced Filtering Capabilities.

### Exercise Picker Filtering

- [ ] **PICK-01**: Search input filters exercises by name only (not category)
- [ ] **PICK-02**: Category dropdown appears above search input
- [ ] **PICK-03**: Category dropdown defaults to "All Categories"
- [ ] **PICK-04**: Category dropdown lists all 7 categories (Chest, Back, Shoulders, Legs, Arms, Core, Other)
- [ ] **PICK-05**: Selecting a category filters the exercise list to that category
- [ ] **PICK-06**: Search and category filter work together (combined filtering)

### Chart Exercise Selector

- [ ] **CHART-01**: Exercise dropdown only shows exercises with logged session data
- [ ] **CHART-02**: When no exercises have data, show message instead of dropdown

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

(None for this milestone)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Equipment filtering | Future enhancement, beyond v2.8 scope |
| Remembering last category selection | Adds complexity, "All Categories" default is sufficient |
| Category filtering on chart selector | Only need to filter by logged data |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| PICK-01 | Phase 14 | Pending |
| PICK-02 | Phase 14 | Pending |
| PICK-03 | Phase 14 | Pending |
| PICK-04 | Phase 14 | Pending |
