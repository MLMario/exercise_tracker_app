# Milestone v2.8: Enhanced Filtering Capabilities

**Status:** In Progress
**Phases:** 14-15
**Total Plans:** TBD

## Overview

Two filtering improvements: Exercise Picker Modal gets a category dropdown filter that works with the existing search, and Chart Exercise Selector gets filtered to only show exercises with logged session data.

## Phases

### Phase 14: Exercise Picker Category Filter

**Goal:** Users can filter exercises by category in the Exercise Picker Modal

**Dependencies:** None

**Requirements:**
- PICK-01: Search input filters exercises by name only (not category)
- PICK-02: Category dropdown appears above search input
- PICK-03: Category dropdown defaults to "All Categories"
- PICK-04: Category dropdown lists all 7 categories (Chest, Back, Shoulders, Legs, Arms, Core, Other)
- PICK-05: Selecting a category filters the exercise list to that category
- PICK-06: Search and category filter work together (combined filtering)

**Success Criteria:**
1. User opens Exercise Picker and sees category dropdown above search input
2. User selects "Chest" from dropdown and only chest exercises appear
3. User types "press" in search with "Chest" selected and sees only chest exercises containing "press"
4. User clears category (selects "All Categories") and search shows all matching exercises again
5. Category text in exercise rows does not trigger search matches

**Plans:** 1 plan
- [x] 14-01-PLAN.md - Add category dropdown with combined filter logic

### Phase 15: Chart Exercise Selector Filter

**Goal:** Users only see exercises with logged data when selecting chart exercises

**Dependencies:** None (can run parallel to Phase 14)

**Requirements:**
- CHART-01: Exercise dropdown only shows exercises with logged session data
- CHART-02: When no exercises have data, show message instead of dropdown

**Success Criteria:**
1. User opens progress chart and exercise dropdown only lists exercises they have actually logged
2. Exercises without any session data do not appear in the dropdown
3. User with no logged sessions sees a message instead of an empty dropdown

**Plans:**
- [ ] TBD
