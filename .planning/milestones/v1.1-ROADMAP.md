## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Used useRef pattern for closure-safe state access in auth listener callback
- Kept console.error for actual error handling, only removed console.log
- Chart delete button uses subtle 32x32 icon style with red hover
- Logout button positioned in sticky header with red danger hover

**Issues Resolved:**
- UAT-001: Workout visibility on alt-tab (stale closure in auth listener)
- UAT-002: Password recovery routing (hash not cleared after success)
- UAT-003: Max Weight chart metric not displaying (missing type/handler)
- UAT-004: Debug console.log statements in production

**Issues Deferred:**
None - all v1.1 scope items completed.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
None
