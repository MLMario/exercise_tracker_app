# Milestone v2.3: Template Editor UI Cleanup

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-17
**Phases:** 1-2
**Total Plans:** 2

## Overview

A two-phase polish pass focusing on the template editor surface. Phase 1 fixed the header button/title alignment, Phase 2 added proper text truncation with tooltips for exercise names.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Header Layout

**Goal**: App header displays Cancel (btn-secondary), title "New Template", and Save (btn-primary) in a single row: `[Cancel] New Template [Save]`
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Header flexbox layout fix

**Details:**
Added flexbox layout to template-editor-surface header using `.template-editor-surface .app-header` selector. Matched existing dashboard-surface pattern for visual consistency. Cancel button (left), title (center), Save button (right) display in single row.

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/css/styles.css`

### Phase 2: Exercise Name Truncation

**Goal**: Exercise name truncates with ellipsis when text is too long, with full name shown in tooltip on hover
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: CSS truncation and tooltip implementation

**Details:**
Added `title` attribute to exercise-name span for native browser tooltip showing full exercise name on hover. CSS truncation was already in place from prior work.

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/src/surfaces/template-editor/ExerciseEditor.tsx`

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Decision: Template-editor only scope (Rationale: Keep changes scoped to avoid unintended side effects)
- Decision: Match dashboard-surface pattern (Rationale: Consistent header flexbox layout across surfaces)
- Decision: Use native browser title attribute (Rationale: Simplest tooltip solution, works across all browsers)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Header button/title alignment now consistent
- Exercise names no longer overflow their container

**Issues Deferred:**

None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

None
