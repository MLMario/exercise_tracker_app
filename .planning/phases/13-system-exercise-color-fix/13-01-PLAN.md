<objective>
Remove the CSS rule that makes system exercises display with muted gray text in the exercise picker.

Purpose: Visual consistency - system exercises should look the same as user exercises, differentiated only by the "Custom" badge on user exercises.

Output: Updated styles.css with the system exercise color override removed.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Remove system exercise color override CSS rule</name>
  <files>apps/web/css/styles.css</files>
  <action>
Delete lines 2815-2818 (the comment and CSS rule):
```css
/* System exercise name - muted */
.exercise-list-item.system .exercise-item-name {
  color: #a1a1aa;
}
```

This removes the color override so that the base `.exercise-item-name` rule with `color: #fafafa` applies to ALL exercises (both system and user).

Do NOT:
- Remove the `.system` class from ExercisePickerModal.tsx (keep it for potential future use)
- Modify any other CSS rules
- Add a new override (just delete the existing one)
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Run `grep -n "exercise-list-item.system .exercise-item-name" apps/web/css/styles.css` - should return no matches
2. Run `grep -n "color: #a1a1aa" apps/web/css/styles.css` - should return no matches in exercise picker section
3. Run `npm run build` - should complete without errors
  </verify>
  <done>
- CSS rule for `.exercise-list-item.system .exercise-item-name` no longer exists in styles.css
- Build succeeds
- All exercises will now inherit the `#fafafa` white color from `.exercise-item-name`
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. CSS check: No `.exercise-list-item.system .exercise-item-name` selector in styles.css
2. Build check: `npm run build` completes successfully
3. Visual check (UAT): Open exercise picker, system exercises display with bright white text matching user exercises
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] System exercise color override CSS rule removed from styles.css
- [ ] Build passes
- [ ] Visually: system exercises in picker show same white text color as user exercises
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/13-system-exercise-color-fix/13-01-SUMMARY.md`
