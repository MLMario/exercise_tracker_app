<objective>
Create empty iOS app scaffold in the monorepo for future React Native development.

Purpose: Establish the `apps/ios/` structure so the monorepo is ready for iOS app development when needed.
Output: Placeholder files in `apps/ios/` that integrate with pnpm workspace.
</objective>

</execution_context>

<context>
@.planning/PROJECT.md
@.planning/ROADMAP.md
@packages/shared/package.json
@pnpm-workspace.yaml

**Monorepo structure:**
- apps/web/ - existing Vite + Preact web app
- packages/shared/ - @ironlift/shared types, services, lib

**Workspace config:** pnpm-workspace.yaml includes `apps/*` so apps/ios/ will auto-join workspace.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create iOS app package.json</name>
  <files>apps/ios/package.json</files>
  <action>
Create minimal package.json for the iOS app placeholder:
- name: "@ironlift/ios"
- version: "0.0.1"
- private: true
- description: "IronFactor iOS app (React Native - coming soon)"
- Add @ironlift/shared as workspace dependency
- No scripts or devDependencies yet (placeholder only)
  </action>
  <verify>cat apps/ios/package.json shows valid JSON with correct name and shared dependency</verify>
  <done>package.json exists with @ironlift/shared dependency</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create iOS app README</name>
  <files>apps/ios/README.md</files>
  <action>
Create README explaining:
- This is a placeholder for future React Native development
- Will share types/services with web via @ironlift/shared
- Setup instructions will be added when development starts
Keep it brief (10-15 lines).
  </action>
  <verify>cat apps/ios/README.md shows placeholder content</verify>
  <done>README.md exists explaining future plans</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create src placeholder and verify workspace</name>
  <files>apps/ios/src/.gitkeep</files>
  <action>
Create apps/ios/src/.gitkeep to establish source directory.
Run `pnpm install` from root to verify workspace recognizes ios app.
  </action>
  <verify>pnpm ls --filter @ironlift/ios shows the package is recognized</verify>
  <done>iOS app appears in workspace, src/ directory exists</done>
</task>

- [ ] `apps/ios/package.json` exists with valid JSON
- [ ] `apps/ios/README.md` explains placeholder status
- [ ] `apps/ios/src/.gitkeep` exists
- [ ] `pnpm ls` shows @ironlift/ios in workspace
- [ ] No build errors from workspace
