# Roadmap: v4.0 Exercise History

## Overview

Exercise History milestone adds the ability to browse past workouts from the Settings panel. Users can view a timeline of completed workouts and tap into any workout to see full exercise/set details. Extends the existing SettingsPanel with new `panelView` states for history browsing.
