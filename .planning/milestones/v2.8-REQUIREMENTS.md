# Requirements: Exercise Tracker App

**Defined:** 2026-02-02
**Core Value:** Simple, effective workout tracking with clean visual feedback on progress

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for v2.8 Enhanced Filtering Capabilities.

### Exercise Picker Filtering

- [x] **PICK-01**: Search input filters exercises by name only (not category)
- [x] **PICK-02**: Category dropdown appears above search input
- [x] **PICK-03**: Category dropdown defaults to "All Categories"
- [x] **PICK-04**: Category dropdown lists all 7 categories (Chest, Back, Shoulders, Legs, Arms, Core, Other)
- [x] **PICK-05**: Selecting a category filters the exercise list to that category
- [x] **PICK-06**: Search and category filter work together (combined filtering)

### Chart Exercise Selector

- [x] **CHART-01**: Exercise dropdown only shows exercises with logged session data
- [x] **CHART-02**: When no exercises have data, show message instead of dropdown

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Equipment filtering | Future enhancement, beyond v2.8 scope |
| Remembering last category selection | Adds complexity, "All Categories" default is sufficient |
| Category filtering on chart selector | Only need to filter by logged data |
