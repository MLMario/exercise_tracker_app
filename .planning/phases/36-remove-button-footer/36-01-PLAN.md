Purpose: Confirm prior phases completed these UI elements, run verification, and mark phase complete.
Output: Verification that mockup design is matched, SUMMARY.md documenting completion.

**Prior implementation status:**
- Phase 33 restructured exercise card header with Add Set button and removed move buttons
- Phase 34 implemented set table grid redesign with checkbox-style delete
- Phase 35 implemented MM:SS rest timer with ±10s buttons

**Phase 36 goals from ROADMAP:**
- Hover-reveal remove button
- Full-width "Add Exercise" footer button

**Current implementation analysis:**
Both goals appear to already be implemented:

1. **Hover-reveal remove button** - CSS lines 1861-1889 in styles.css:
   - `.exercise-editor-card .btn-remove { opacity: 0; }` (hidden by default)
   - `.exercise-editor-card .card-header:hover .btn-remove { opacity: 1; }` (revealed on hover)
   - ExerciseEditor.tsx line 143-148 has the btn-remove button in card header

2. **Full-width Add Exercise footer** - ExerciseList.tsx lines 79-88:
   - `<div class="footer-actions">` wrapper
   - `<button class="btn btn-primary btn-block">Add Exercise</button>`
   - CSS `.btn-block { width: 100%; }` at line 1902-1904

<verification>
Before declaring phase complete:
- [ ] Hover-reveal remove button CSS verified (opacity 0→1 on hover)
- [ ] Remove button JSX verified in ExerciseEditor card header
- [ ] Footer actions with btn-block verified in ExerciseList
- [ ] TypeScript build passes
</verification>

<success_criteria>

- All verification checks pass
- No code changes required (prior phases completed the work)
- Phase can be marked complete
</success_criteria>

# Phase 36 Plan 01: Remove Button & Footer Summary

**Phase 36 goals verified as already implemented in prior phases**

## Accomplishments

- Verified hover-reveal remove button implemented (Phase 33)
- Verified full-width Add Exercise footer implemented (prior architecture)
- No code changes needed - all goals met by existing implementation

## Files Created/Modified

None - verification only

## Decisions Made

Phase 36 work was completed as part of earlier phase implementations:
- Card header restructure in Phase 33 included btn-remove with hover-reveal CSS
- ExerciseList architecture from Phase 8 included footer-actions pattern

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness

Ready for Phase 37: CSS & Polish (final consolidation)
